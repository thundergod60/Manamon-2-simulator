Hello everyone!
I am Vatshal Gautam, as you know, and I'm happy to announce a manamon 2 fan based battle simulator!
Please do note:
1. It's not connected to manamon, at least not directly
2. It's not for comercial purpose, since it's free and I'm not asking anyone to pay me for this

This manamon 2 battle simulator will allow you and your friend to battle and trade online without manamon's server! So it's good for if there's something happened with your manamon 2 that is not allowing you to battle, and you miss battling in manamon 2
Features may be added time to time, so make sure to check my post especially if it's named to something like 'Manamon 2 simulator update!' and such

Features:
Fully menu driven, that is, you use arrow keys to navigate in the main battle screen
Can battle yourself by running two instances
Trading and battling support
Full battle log which allows you to read your battles anytime
Hassle free, no downloading needed

Please do note this too. Since it's a simulator only, so you can't trade in real time, but can battle in real time though, as everything is chosen by you. But still, it's not real time as it was of manamon's own server. It's designed for fun

Also, there are no musics, no battle music, no attack sound, no manamon sound. Please reply me with where I can find manamon's sounds, attack sounds and every sound, so I can add them to this simulator

How to use:
It's a python script, so please do note first. Just click on it well
Also, please do note that you use NVDA, and have 64 bit of python installed. If you don't have python installed, please do it on python.org. Also, please make sure that you have 64 bit system, for now. Support for 32 bit users will be added soon.
First, open the aam folder. You'll find a file named teambuilder.py.
Click on it, and it'll ask you for trainer name and such. Then, it'll ask you manamon's name (not nickname), level, HP and moves name which are in four slots, which are four.
Please do note. Use NVDA + up arrow to read everything displayed in the teambuilder script and follow the instructions, which are HP, level, manamon's name and all moves.

After you have built a team, there will be a myteam.json file, which contains all of the informations you have typed in the teambuilder.py
I hope you don't cheat by giving any manamon any moves, or typing wrong name of manamon deliberately, as it only recognizes which are wrong moves or right one, that is still not guaranteed since if you have deleted the manamon moves.txt from the aam folder
After you have built a team, get ready to go into the world of battling!
First, run simplebattle.py. At here, you're NVDA will speak things directly, so no need for guesswork. Heh!
Type h for if you want to host, or j if you want to join and then press enter
If you're hosting, you'll be asked for what type of battle you want, like 1v1, 2v2 etc. Please note that the battle type depends on both of the tamers, for example, if you have selected 6 v6 and the one who is joining, if one of you only have 5 manamon, it'll do 5v5, to avoid crash.
After that battle type screen, just press enter and your NVDA will say. "Waiting for opponent..."
If you're joining and someone has hosted for you, you have to type h and press enter, then you'll be presented by the same battle type screen, so here, you, the joiner can also select the battle type too, but if both of you didn't agreed the same, it will switch to minimum, which is 1v1. Then, you'll be presented to type host's IP adress. Below, I'm covering which IP adresses, when to type.
Localhost or 127.0.0.1 or something like, which is by default, so you just press enter or type that
It's for when you're running two instances, or simply, using same PC
PC's name or 192.168.x.x: If you and your friend are using same wifi	
If you and your friends are using different metwork, you have to type your public IP, which you can check by going to whatismyip.com, or whatismyipadress.com, or by any site which can tell what is your public IP
After typing that, you're all set! everything is self explanatory, that is, attack, switch manamon, view enemy information and so on.
Just one note, you can't go back to the main menu, which is by escape in manamon and manamon 2, and you can't rematch, I mean there's no option for rematchin or such, so after anyone win or loses, you have to do the battle thing again

Trading is simple. Hosting and joining is same, just it don't have NVDA direct speech helper command, so you have to either press nvda + up arrow, or select it all by control + A, and paste it into notepad and look the contents to the last, which is by control + end key, and check there which is exactly you have to do.
Trading is also real time, if you talk by in this simulator, that is, you can trade manamon between you and your friend's manamon, for example, your friend's manamon's HP is 300, and you're is 200, so you can exchange that too.

Also, here, the bufs and debuffing moves also deal damage, like manatise and demanatise, and mvoes also subliminal radiowave and sing also do damage. Damage is depend on strength, and same is of defence and speed that who attacks first. It's randomized.

Thanks, and happy taming!
